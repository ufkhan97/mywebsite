                    This website is brand new and still under construction. I am coding it from scratch as a way to teach myself web development.

                    I&apos;ve really enjoyed making this site and if you visit often enough you&apos;ll doubtless see it changing all the time. The code for the site will be added to my github in case anyone would like to see it.

                    This website will also be a playground of sorts for my ideas -- good and bad (probably more of the latter). For example, I may later add any of the following: a blog, coding tutorials, Snake, and/or my attempts at writing short stories.
